- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ZackNewsMan. I am an investigative data producer for 9Wants to Know, the investigative arm for 9NEWS (KUSA-TV) in Denver, Colorado. I have been an investigative journalist since 2016 and a member of 9Wants to Know since 2019.
I use open records laws to obtain and analyze public data to identify systematic problems. I also act as an off-air reporter, pursuing long and short-term stories for 9NEWS. I am passionate about elevating underserved voices in all realms, especially on the topics of government (how taxpayer dollars are spent), environment (especially water & climate change), ethics (are officials using their position appropriately?), the fallout from COVID-19, education and the criminal justice system (if itâ€™s broken, how do we fix it?). I also seek to identify inequities and possible fixes in every story. 

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning R and SQL.
