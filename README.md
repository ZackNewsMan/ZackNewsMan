ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ZackNewsMan. I am a freelance investigative data journalist. I most recently worked for 9Wants to Know, the investigative arm for 9NEWS (KUSA-TV) in Denver, Colorado. I have been an investigative journalist since 2016 and worked for 9NEWS from 2019 to 2023.

I persistently weave data and records into a compelling narrative designed to pull readers and viewers in. My award-winning investigative data work led to changes in laws and policies, exposed an international human trafficking ring, inspired the American Civil Liberties Union to sue Denver Police, prompted a Congressional inquiry, and compelled a sheriffâ€™s office to fire a troublesome deputy. 

I use open records laws to obtain and analyze public data to identify systematic problems. I am passionate about elevating underserved voices in all realms, especially on the topics of government (how taxpayer dollars are spent), environment (especially water & climate change), ethics (are officials using their position appropriately?), the fallout from COVID-19, education and the criminal justice system (if itâ€™s broken, how do we fix it?). I also seek to identify inequities and possible fixes in every story. 

I have won numerous national and regional awards including an Emmy, Murrow, Sigma Delta Chi and Headliner.
